## 🚀 Project Overview  

**OpenMRC** is a global community-driven project developing a **video/audio recorder** based on Raspberry Pi hardware.  
Our goal is to bring back the workflow of classic FireWire-based Digital Tape Equipment (DTE) recorders — but with a modern, open-source twist.  

Currently, around **8 contributors worldwide** are actively working on both hardware and software.

## 🛠️ Hardware  

[🔗 OpenMRC Hardware Repository](https://github.com/openMRC/Hardware)  

The main hardware path right now is the **FireBoard**, a CM5-based carrier board with integrated FireWire.  

### FireBoard Features  
- Built-in FireWire chip (VT6315N)  
- Full-size HDMI  
- DSI/CSI ports  
- USB3 port  
- MicroSD slot  
- FireWire port  
- ~90% design complete, validation in progress before prototype order  
- 3D-printable cases being designed in parallel

## 💻 Software  

[🔗 OpenMRC Software Repository](https://github.com/openMRC/Software)  

Software development is centered on making OpenMRC reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.  

### Highlights  
- **FFmpeg** selected as the core recording engine (replacing dvgrab)  
  - Realtime preview via `ffplay`  
  - Expanded feature support  
- Plans for a **stripped-down kernel** for better efficiency  
- UI design:  
  - Hybrid touchscreen + rotary encoder (inspired by iPods & iPhones)  
- Development in C and exploration of Qt for GUI  
- Features under development:  
  - Built-in level gauge  
  - Precompiled kernel for easy deployment  
  - Potential dedicated OpenMRC distribution

## 🎨 Design & Community  

- 3D-printed cases designed in parallel with hardware  
- Artists needed for an **official OpenMRC logo**  
- Active discussions and updates happening on Discord and Reddit
